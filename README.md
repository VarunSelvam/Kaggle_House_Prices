# Kaggle_House_Prices

For this project, I utilized R to help with predicting the prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. The primary method utilized for this project was Linear Regression. The objective was to get an R-squared above 75% or higher. I again did this project with a group and the new objective was to get an R^2 of 85% or higher.

During the course of this project, I had to deal with NA values. To deal with the NA Values, we used imputation or removed the column if too many of the values were missing. (Too many values missing was defined as 60% of greater.) 

Finally, we utilized cross-validation to validate our model and ensure that overfitting was not occuring.
